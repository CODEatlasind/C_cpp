Class is collection of data memeber and memeber methods. They are the enablers of OOPs principles like inheritance and polymorphism in cpp.

Class 'Name'
{
   access_specifier: //public, private, protected
     data_members;
     member_methods();
};

Struct are a collation of data members and members methods lke classes but they don't enable inheritance and can be seen as a wrapper for other primitive types of data types.

Struct 'Name'
{
   access_specifier: //public, private, protected
     data_members;
     member_methods();
};
