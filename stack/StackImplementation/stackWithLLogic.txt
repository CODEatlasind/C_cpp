Stack using linkedlist:
Property of linkedlist is that it can only be called via a head. To perform any operation I need to go to the head and the traverse.

Push(int a) -> insert element in the 1st node
Push(int a) -> insert element in the 2nd node
Push(int a) -> insert element in the 3rd node

Push(int a):
Everytime push action is performed a new node is created with the data provided. 
The next of it stores the address of head and the new head is assigned this address.

Pop():
The head is replaced by next value of current head until head is not null.

Top():
Head data

Size():
int counter 

isEmpty(): Based on this counter
